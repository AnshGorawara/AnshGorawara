### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ansh Gorawara.

I'm a **Data Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**, driven to build elegant, impactful solutions with data. My journey through Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and the US has given me a unique global perspective on how technology can solve real-world business problems.

My background is in business strategy, where I saw firsthand how data-driven decisions could **reduce procurement costs by 15%** or **increase donor engagement by 25%**. That experience ignited my passion to move beyond just *analyzing* data to *building* the technical systems that predict and act upon those insights.
