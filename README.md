Hello, I'm Ansh Gorawara ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), driven to use data to build elegant, impactful solutions. My journey has taken me through Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and the United States, giving me a unique global lens through which I view the power of technology.

My Journey to Data Science

My early experiences were in the fast-paced worlds of marketing and business strategy. [cite_start]Working with companies in Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi, I saw firsthand how data-driven insights could transform a businessâ€”from optimizing procurement costs to shaping product launch strategies[cite: 722, 1136, 1817]. This ignited my passion to move beyond just analyzing data to building the technical systems that predict and act upon it. This is why I am pursuing a rigorous education in Data Science at UIC.

My Focus Right Now (Fall 2025)

Mastering core concepts in Data Structures & Algorithms (CS 251) and applied Probability & Statistics (IE 342).

Building my first major portfolio project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python.

Preparing for a high-impact Technology Risk Consulting Internship at Ernst & Young (EY).
