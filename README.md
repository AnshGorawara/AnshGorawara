Ansh Gorawara ðŸ‘‹
Data Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) with a global perspective forged across Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and the US. I'm driven to move beyond just analyzing data to building the technical systems that create solutions.

My Journey to Data
My background is in business strategy and marketing, where I conducted competitive analysis and market feasibility studies for product launches. I saw firsthand how data-driven decisions could reduce costs by 15% or increase donor engagement by 25%. That experience ignited my passion for the technical sideâ€”to build the tools that predict and act upon these insights. That's why I'm here.

Current Mission: Fall 2025
Core Focus: Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms (CS 251) and applied Probability & Statistics (IE 342).

Portfolio Project: Building my first major project in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python.

Professional Growth: Preparing for a high-impact Technology Risk Consulting Internship at Ernst & Young (EY).

My Arsenal
Languages: Python, Java, C++, SQL

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Statistical Analysis
